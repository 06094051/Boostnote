# Contributing to Boostnote

> This is a temporary document.

It is first time to maintain OSS project for me(Rokt33r). So, I want to watch what's going on here.

**This means you can do whatever you want until I ask to stop it.**

But I want to make only one thing sure.

**If you make a pull request, It means you agree to transfer the copyright of the code changes to MAISIN&CO.**

This is because our team want to have an option to change LICENSE of this app.
> It doesn't mean Boostnote will become a paid app. If we want to earn some money, We will try other ways, some kind of cloud storage or Mobile app integration.
> We thought this is needed to replace the license with much freer one(like BSD, MIT).
